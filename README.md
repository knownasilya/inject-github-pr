# Test utility for Strider 2 (core)

## Usage
node inject-github-pr <project uuid>

If you run this without a uuid it will generate one for you (not
only that; it will also generate a new project).

You may want to write down the uuid this program generates
for you in case you want to submit a job to the same project 
again.
